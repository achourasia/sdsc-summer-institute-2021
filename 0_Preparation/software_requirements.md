## Machine Learning  <a name="mach-learn"></a>

Participants who will be attending the Machine Learning Overview parallel session will need to install R (https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio Desktop open source edition (https://www.rstudio.com/) on their laptops. 

A basic understanding of R will be very helpful and we recommend the following resources:

* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf
* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html

### Scientific visualization with Visit (scheduled opposite Machine Learning Overview) <a name="visit"></a>

Participants who will be attending the Scientific visualization with Visit session should make the following preparations.

* Computer, a mouse with scroll wheel is strongly recommended.

* [Download](https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/releases-as-tables/) and install VisIt. Please do not compile from source unless you are adventurous.
   ** Install version 3.2.1
   ** Mac users will need to grant VisIt permissions to read files from locations other than home directory (System preferences > Privacy > Full disk access) 
   
* Test run VisIt application on your laptop to make sure it works

* [Download](http://users.sdsc.edu/~amit/scivis-tutorial/visit_data_files.zip) sample data. Unzip to your Home directory.
